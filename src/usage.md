# Using Cliweather

This portion of the docs is still in progress, and will be updated as the beginning prototypes are built.

## Command line

As of right now, the command line is the only way to access the program.

**When cliw is entered into the terminal, it should display a help menu**
```bash,editable
$ cliw
```

And then you can enter any of the subcommands or their options to get output to the terminal.
The project is at a very early stage right now and only the cli is functional, the logic is not yet implemented.
