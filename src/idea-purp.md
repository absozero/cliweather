# Idea of the app
Open source. Now, and always.

This app's purpose is meant to fix the problem. It will grab weather from multiple weather api's, some are `proprietary`.

> "I can't see my weather from the cli :("

> "Can't I selfhost weather info but get data from an outside source?"

This app will certainly help to solve that problem. It will allow you to have a cli interface as well as a selfhosted web interface for gui users. Since the api is external, it calls them as part of the program. You can expose the service or whatever you would like to do with it.
