# ATTENTION!
# THIS REPOSITORY WILL BECOME UNMAINTAINED AND AS OF NOW IS DEPRECATED.
This is in favor of tools like wttr.in and wego(chceck their github!), and if this project is reinitialized in the future, it will likely become a client for the wttr.in service or
another open source weather system.




# [Cliweather](https://absozero.github.io/cliweather):cloud:
> The weather app that is free and open source, can use multiple providers, and runs in the command line and a web interface..

Having to check a website for your weather could be sucky, depending on your mood. To check multiple, to cross reference and get accurate weather, even worse. To solve this problem, :sparkle:cliweather was made. :sparkle:
For the geeks out there, you can view the weather just from the cli, and for selfhosters, you can host a web ui of the app, and see it in a browser, all locally, except the calls to external weather api's. For people who just want to see the weather, both of these options are easy to get set up with. No tracking and open source.
