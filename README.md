Having to check multiple websites to get a good prediction could be bad, depending on your mood.
To cross reference, even worse. To solve this problem, cliweather was made.

For the geeks out there, you can view the weather just from the cli, and for selfhosters, you can host a web ui of the app, and see it in a browser. 

This is done all locally, except the calls to external weather api's.
For people who just want to see the weather, both of these options are easy to get set up with. 
No tracking and this project is fully open source.
